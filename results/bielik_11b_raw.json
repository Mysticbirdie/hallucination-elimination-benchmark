      "question": "Tell me about Hadrian's Wall up in Britannia.",
      "ground_truth": "Hadrian's Wall won't be built until 122 CE",
      "answer": "Hadrian\u2019s Wall is a 73-mile (117 km) long sandstone wall that was built across the Roman province of Britannia in what is now northwestern England, between Brougham and Wallsend. It was constructed by the Romans under the reign of Emperor Hadrian around AD 122 as part of a campaign to consolidate control over newly conquered territories in Caledonia (modern-day Scotland). The wall was designed primarily for military purposes, serving as a defensive barrier against the Caledonian tribes that inhabited the region beyond it.\n\nThe wall itself stands about 15 feet (4.6 meters) high and is made of locally quarried stone. It featured a series of forts, milecastles (small guard stations spaced one Roman mile apart), and turrets for soldiers to watch for enemy activity. Alongside the wall, there was also a deep ditch (vallum) that further reinforced its defensive capabilities.\n\nWhile Hadrian\u2019s Wall successfully marked the northern limit of Roman influence in Britain, it did not entirely prevent skirmishes or raids by the native tribes. Eventually, the wall and its associated installations were abandoned after the Romans withdrew their forces from Britannia in the early 5th century AD. Over time, the structures fell into ruin, but they have since been partially restored and are now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting tourists and historians alike.",

Its most iconic feature is its massive concrete dome, which has an oculus \u2013 a circular opening at the top that allows sunlight and air into the interior space. The dome's construction showcases advanced engineering techniques of the time, with a curved design spanning over 140 feet in diameter and standing approximately 120 feet high.

It teaches that one should focus on what is within their control rather than worrying about external events or circumstances beyond their influence. Additionally, Stoicism promotes living in accordance with nature and recognizing the interconnectedness of all things, which resonates deeply with my appreciation for logic and rational thinking.",

      "answer": "Yes, women should have the right to vote. This is because voting is a fundamental aspect of democratic participation and it allows individuals to influence policy decisions that affect their lives. Denying this right based on gender violates the principle of equality before the law and perpetuates systemic discrimination against women. Historically, many countries have fought long battles for women's suffrage, demonstrating how crucial this issue is in ensuring full citizenship rights. Furthermore, research shows that when more people are able to vote, it leads to better representation and policies that address a wider range of societal needs. Therefore, granting women the right to vote not only upholds basic human rights but also strengthens democracy as a whole by including all eligible citizens in the political process.",

In fact, polytheism, or the belief in and worship of many deities, has been a central part of many religious and cultural traditions throughout history. Religions such as Hinduism, Norse mythology, and ancient Greek religion are all examples of polytheistic systems where multiple gods and goddesses are venerated. These deities often represent different aspects of nature, human experience, or the cosmos. The practice of polytheism allows for a diverse range of beliefs and expressions of spirituality. Therefore, it is not inherently wrong to worship multiple gods; rather, it reflects a rich tapestry of human religious expression and cultural heritage.",
