It was a significant uprising against Roman authority in Judea, led by various Jewish factions who sought to expel Roman control and establish an independent Jewish state. The revolt was brutally suppressed by the Roman military, resulting in heavy casualties and the destruction of several key cities.

While it is not unheard of for a wealthy patron to take on an adult as a client or protege, formal legal adoption (adoptio) typically involves children to secure familial succession and inheritance. Adopting an adult might be seen as a way to integrate someone into one's social circle or provide them with protection, but it would not carry the same legal weight as adopting a child.

Silk is primarily imported from the East via the Silk Road, often obtained through intermediaries like Parthian merchants.
